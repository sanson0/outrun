## Features

* Boardgame with 25 tiles
* The player is represented by a star that moves from tile to tile
* When the player reaches a question mark, the tiles begin to show a sequence of coloured shapes.
* Shapes consist of a square, triangle, diamond and rectangle.
* Colours consist of red, blue, green and yellow.
* When the sequence ends, the player is asked to type in the sequence according to colour or shape, this is decided randomly by the program.
* The tiles revert to the boardgame mode.
* If the player gets it right, then the player keeps moving.
* If the player gets it wrong, then the player pauses before moving again.
* After a short while, the beginning tiles turn black, this is the shadow chasing the player.
* If there are too many wrong answers, the shadow can catch the player and the player loses that game.
* If there are enough right answers, the player can outrun the shadow and win that game.

## User stories

As a player, I would like:-
* a game that requires memorising patterns so that I can improve my memory
* to progress through the game so that I can escape danger.
* a lot of interaction with the game so I feel involved.
* an easy and hard mode so I can remain challenged as I improve at the game.
